Dear Incoming Student:

Welcome to the University of California, Irvine! Below is information regarding two very important University of California mandated requirements that have compliance deadlines associated with them and, therefore, require that you take several actions. These requirements are administered by UCI's Student Health Center.

### 1 TB RISK SCREENING and IMMUNIZATIONS REQUIREMENT

A.  ALL incoming UC students are REQUIRED to obtain four (4) specific vaccines and complete a Tuberculosis Risk Screening questionnaire or provide documentation demonstrating compliance with these requirements.

B. How To Comply With Your Tuberculosis and Immunization Requirements  These requirements are satisfied by: 1) completing the TB Screening Questionnaire online; 2) entering your vaccination dates online; and 3) uploading your immunization records online via the Wellness, Health &  Counseling Services Student Health Portal at  <https://osh.chs.uci.edu> . Refer to the UC TB Screening and Immunization Requirements page on SHC's website at  <https://shc.uci.edu/new-student-information/immunization-requirements> for instructions and other important information pertaining to these health requirements. 

C.    Compliance Deadlines

​        It is strongly recommended that these requirements be completed before you arrive at UCI for the start of the Fall Quarter (or Semester). However, a grace period is provided.

​        FINAL DEADLINE FOR INCOMING **UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE** STUDENTS (EXCEPT LAW STUDENTS): FRIDAY, **OCTOBER 26, 2018** 

​        FINAL DEADLINE FOR INCOMING LAW STUDENTS: FRIDAY, **OCTOBER 19, 2018**

D.   If you haven't completed these health requirements by the above deadline date, an academic hold (Type 2) will be placed onto your record by SHC and you will be unable to enroll in Winter Quarter (or Spring Semester)   classes.

E.    Over the course of the next several months, you will receive emails from SHC via the secure Student Health Portal regarding these requirements either because you remain non-compliant or if SHC has questions regarding the information that you submitted online. Please logon to the Student Health Portal on a regular basis to view and respond to secure messages that you may receive from SHC.

For questions related to the TB Risk Screening and Immunization requirements, please email SHC's Front Office/Health Information Management department at [shc-immunization@uci.edu](mailto:shc-immunization@uci.edu) .

### 2 HEALTH INSURANCE REQUIREMENT

A.    All registered undergraduate and graduate students are required to have health insurance and are automatically enrolled in the University's Student Health Insurance Plan (UC SHIP). Your registration fees will include the  UC SHIP premiums and related fees. 

1.	Enroll in UC SHIP? You are automatically enrolled and, therefore, no action is required.

2.	waiver criteria and you do not want to be enrolled in UC SHIP, you must apply online for a UC SHIP waiver within the posted waiver periods and by the published deadline date.  <https://shc.uci.edu/insurance/waiving-ship> 

  - The waiver period for Fall quarter opens on 6-25-2018 and closes on 9-7-2018. **New, incoming students are not able to waive until your registration fees are assessed. Fee assessment typically occurs in mid-to-late July.**
  - Note that "early start" 1st year/returning medical students and 1st year/returning/transfer law students have different waiver periods and deadline dates than students who start on the regular Fall term start date.

Visit SHC's Insurance Services website for UC SHIP waiver [schedules](https://shc.uci.edu/insurance/waiving-ship ) 

B.    **No exceptions are granted if you miss the UC SHIP waiver deadline date.** If you forget to waive UC SHIP, you will pay for and have UC SHIP coverage during the Fall quarter (or semester). If you don't want UC SHIP for the succeeding terms, then you will need to waive out during the posted waiver period for the Winter Quarter (or Spring Semester).

For questions related to UC SHIP, please email the SHC Insurance Services department at [shc-insurance@uci.edu](mailto:shc-insurance@uci.edu) .
